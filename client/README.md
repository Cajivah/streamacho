#### Configuring ESLint on JetBrains IDEs
1. Press `ctrl+alt+s`
2. Go to Plugins tab 
3. Click `Browse repositories`
4. Search `ESLint` and install plugin
5. Restart IDE
6. Press `ctrl+alt+s`
7. Search `eslint` in Settings window
8. Check `Enable` checkbox

That's all. You are now able to fix files by 
pressing `alt+enter` on places pointed out by ESLint
and selecting `ESLint: fix current file`.
Unfortunately, this tool isn't so clever and there would
occur some errors that it won't be able to fix. Please keep it in mind.
